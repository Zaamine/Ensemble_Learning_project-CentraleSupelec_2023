The global_results.ipynb notebook summarizes all the results obtained, and allows to re-fit all the saved models.

The experimented models are tuned and saved in separate notebooks in the folder 'models'.

All the notebooks rely on helper functions stored in the folder 'functions'.

The decision tree algorithm coded from scratch and the tsne embedding performed on textual data have been stored in separate folders.
